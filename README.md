# CRUDFunctionality-PHP

CRUD in PHP involves creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in a database. "Create" inserts new data, "Read" retrieves data, "Update" modifies existing data, and "Delete" removes data. Each operation requires proper handling of user input and execution of SQL queries or ORM methods for database interaction.

XAMPP was used to create this project.

Seperate tables for information are linked by a unique key (ID)
